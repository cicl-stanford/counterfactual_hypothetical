## code

### R

Analysis and plotting script. You can view a rendered html file of the analysis [here](https://cicl-stanford.github.io/counterfactual_hypothetical/). 

### experiments

The experiments were programmed using [psiturk](https://psiturk.org/). Experiment 1 asked for causal judgments, Experiment 2 asked for counterfactual judgments, and Experiment 3 asked for hypothetical judgments. 

### python

Modeling code that implements the simulation model. This code base was also used to create the video clips. 

## data

Contains anonymized database from all three experiments combined. 

## figures

Figures from the paper, and experiment screenshots. 

## videos

Video clips used in the experiments.
